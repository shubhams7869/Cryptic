# Cryptic
Cryptography algorithm -Basic

This is a secret based cryptography algotrithm to encrypt and decrypt a message.
This utility can be used for cryptography of passwords using secret key.

This is still under initial development phase and will have further versions to support bit wise encryption, message digest and further more...

let me know for any issues.

Thanks!
